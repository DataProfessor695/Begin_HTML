          <h3>Habit Blog 1</h3>
          <p>I can still remember when I started my blog. I had a burning desire to share some knowledge, but also faced a monumental hurdle. I knew exactly how difficult it would be to build the audience for my blog and just how much time I would have to put into it. <br>

            But I did it anyway.
            
            Initially, looking around at other blogs, the feeling was a bit overwhelming. I knew I needed to instill some solid blogging habits into my routine if I was going to get anywhere near the success that some of my predecessors were seeing with their blogs. <br> And I also knew I was in for a quite an uphill battle.
            
            So I started small. <br>
            
            At the time, I felt like it was better than not starting at all. I kept thinking about that old adage that says ‚ÄúOne year from now, you‚Äôll wish you started today.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs exactly how I felt. I had wished I had started, not just a year ago, but years and years ago. <br> Because that‚Äôs how long it takes to build a successful blog.
            
            Having a background in SEO, I knew that regardless of how great my content strategy might be or how much effort I put into it, the beginning was going to be hard. I knew I had to build trust, and that could only be done over time. <br>
            
            Rather than overthink things too much, I decided to get busy writing. I honed my focus on building excellent content, and laid my faith in the fact that the rest would follow. <br> Yet, that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt all I did. I knew that if I wanted to build a blog, I needed to instill some good blogging habits into my routine. If I didn‚Äôt, I knew I would be dead in the water.
            
            But, it was because of those initial blogging habits that I instilled early on that I was able to keep going. I was able to push past those first grueling months with little to no traffic. <br> I constantly found myself refreshing my analytics to see if anything had changed, only to be disappointed time and time again.
            
            If you‚Äôve built up a successful blog or traffic on any Website, surely you can relate. <br>
            
            But I kept at it. I kept pushing. I didn‚Äôt give up, and eventually, things grew and have continued to grow exponentially. <br> But by no means was it a walk in the park. It was hard, grueling work. It was endless hours of research, writing, editing, and socializing.
            
            Was it worth it? You bet it was. <br>
            
            So, how exactly did I do it?
